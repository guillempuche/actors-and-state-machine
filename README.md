### `ts-result`
[ts-result](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-results) is a TypeScript library that provides Result and Option objects, Ã  la Rust. It allows for more expressive error handling and control flow. It helps in handling success and error states without relying on exceptions, making the code more predictable and easier to maintain.

### `@statelyai/inspect`
[@statelyai/inspect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@statelyai/inspect) is a tool from Stately.ai that allows you to visualize and inspect XState state machines and actor models in real-time. It helps in debugging and understanding the state transitions and events in your application, providing a powerful way to develop and troubleshoot state machines.
